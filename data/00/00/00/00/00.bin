  |   Your space station is about to explode and you only have 60 seconds   |
  |   before things get messy. What (or who) will you grab before you       |
  |   make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle and begin your journey      |
  |   into THE GREAT UNKNOWN?                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This is 60 Parsecs!, a dark comedy sci-fi adventure set in the        |
  |   Atomic Space Age - complete with all the Cold War paranoia,           |
  |   chrome-plated wall accents and cockroaches with space helmets.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Lead a crew of woefully unprepared astronauts, equipped with          |
  |   whatever junk - sorry - "supplies" you can grab before blasting       |
  |   off, on a journey across the cosmos that's best described as          |
  |   misguided. Make the best of it, while dealing with soup shortages     |
  |   and other horrors of outer space. Will you have what it takes to      |
  |   find a new home and survive?                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Bon voyage!                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   SCAVENGE & EVACUATE.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With only 60 seconds before nukes reduce the space station to         |
  |   floating particles in the vacuum of space, frantically grab           |
  |   whatever supplies and crew you can before getting out of there. You   |
  |   never know when that sock puppet will come in handy.                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   SURVIVE & DECIDE.                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Space funerals are inconvenient, so try to avoid dying where          |
  |   possible. Use your limited supplies and (hopefully not limited)       |
  |   wits to make difficult choices and ensure your survival, even         |
  |   though the odds are definitely stacked against you.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   EXPLORE & CRAFT.                                                      |

  |   Duct tape fixes all problems, but how do you fix (or at least         |
  |   craft) duct tape? Chart expeditions to find resources, craft          |
  |   survival essentials and explore strange new worlds in a procedural,   |
  |   very-much-permadeath adventure.                                       |
  |                                                                         |

  |   As captain, it's your duty to keep the crew happy - they're less      |
  |   likely to kill you that way. Manage relationships as you watch them   |
  |   grow closer and hopefully not throw each other out the airlock.       |
  |                                                                         |
